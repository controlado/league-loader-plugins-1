# League Loader Plugins
Plug-ins to use in [League Loader](https://github.com/nomi-san/league-loader)

# How to install the plugins


In League-Loader you have two folders : `plugins` / `assets`

Each folder in this repository represent either a plugin or a theme. Take the one you want, copy `everything` in the plugins folder inside it, paste it in your League-Loader plugins folder. Then copy everything from the `assets` folder and paste it in your League-Loader assets folder.

Sometime, you will notice a `config` folder in the `plugins` folder in this repository. You can safely merge them with any other config folder present in your League-Loader plugins folder.
